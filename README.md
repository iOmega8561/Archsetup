# Archsetup
## Disclaimer
This is a learning project, and although i use it quite a lot without issues, it's really not production-ready so use it carefully.

## What's this?
This is a bash script that performs basic operations to install Arch Linux when booted from an install media. Since i needed to run some ARM64 machines, i decided to include both x86 and ARM64 versions of the exact same script.

## What does it do exactly?
These scripts are very simple, they in fact follow very closely the official [Arch Linux installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide).
